# Linux Structure Overview

Linux is a widely used operating system known for its robustness, flexibility, and open-source nature. It is especially important in cybersecurity due to its security and stability.

## What is Linux?

- An **Operating System (OS)** like Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.
- Manages hardware resources and facilitates communication between software and hardware.
- Comes in many versions called **distributions (distros)** tailored to different needs.
- Examples: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RedHat, Manjaro, Parrot OS (used here).

## History

- Originates from **Unix (1970)** by Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie.
- BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) followed but was limited by lawsuits.
- **GNU Project (1983)** by Richard Stallman aimed to create a free Unix-like OS with the GNU GPL license.
- Linux kernel started as a personal project by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
- Today: millions of lines of code, GPL licensed, over 600 distros.
- Linux powers servers, desktops, embedded systems, and Android devices.

## Philosophy

- Centers on **simplicity, modularity, and openness**.
- Uses small, single-purpose programs that can be chained to perform complex tasks.
- Avoids captive user interfaces; prefers shell/terminal for greater control.
- Configuration data is stored in text files.

**Core Principles:**

| Principle                               | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Everything is a file                   | All configurations and resources are represented as files.                                     |
| Small, single-purpose programs        | Each tool does one job well and can be combined with others.                                   |
| Ability to chain programs              | Tools can be piped together for complex operations.                                            |
| Avoid captive user interfaces          | Shell-based interface gives user direct control.                                               |
| Configuration data in text files      | Example: `/etc/passwd` stores registered users.                                                |

## Components

| Component       | Description                                                                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bootloader      | Code that starts the boot process (e.g., GRUB in Parrot OS).                           |
| OS Kernel       | Core managing hardware resources and system I/O.                                      |
| Daemons         | Background services handling key functions (e.g., scheduling, printing).              |

| Window Manager  | GUI environments (e.g., GNOME, KDE) that provide desktop features.                    |
| Utilities       | Applications performing specific user or system tasks.                                |

## Linux Architecture Layers

| Layer          | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware       | Physical components like CPU, RAM, disks.                                                  |
| Kernel         | Manages hardware resources, virtualizes them for processes, and prevents conflicts.         |
| Shell          | CLI interface for user commands that interact with the kernel.                              |
| System Utility | Provides the OS functionalities available to users.                                         |

## File System Hierarchy (FHS)

Linux organizes files in a tree structure with the root `/` at the top.

| Path     | Description                                                                                          |

## Summary

Linux is a powerful and flexible operating system with a rich history rooted in Unix and GNU projects. Its modular philosophy, layered architecture, and hierarchical filesystem make it ideal for a wide range of applicationsâ€”from servers to embedded systems and mobile devices. Its security, openness, and stability have made it a cornerstone in cybersecurity.

## Additional Notes

- Linux distributions (distros) vary widely to meet different needs.
- Parrot OS, used here, is a Debian-based security-focused distro.
- Mastering Linux involves understanding the shell, filesystem hierarchy, and system components.
