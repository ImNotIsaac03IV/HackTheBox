# Firewall Setup

Firewalls provide a security mechanism to control and monitor network traffic between different network segments, such as internal and external networks or network zones. They protect networks from unauthorized access, malicious traffic, and other security threats.

Linux offers built-in firewall capabilities to filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules, protocols, ports, and other criteria. The goal of firewall implementation depends on organizational needs, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources.

## History of Linux Firewalls

- **iptables** replaced older tools like `ipchains` and `ipfwadm` around 2000 with Linux 2.4 kernel.
- iptables offers a flexible command-line interface for filtering traffic by IP, port, protocol, etc.
- It helps defend against DoS attacks, port scans, and intrusions.
- Linux firewall functionality is implemented through the **Netfilter** kernel framework, with iptables used for rule configuration.

## Firewall Tools in Linux

| Tool       | Description                                                                                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **iptables**  | Flexible, powerful rule-based firewall utility.                                                         |
| **nftables**  | Modern replacement for iptables with improved syntax and performance, but not backward compatible.     |
| **UFW**       | "Uncomplicated Firewall" â€” simpler, user-friendly interface built on iptables.                         |
| **FirewallD** | Dynamic firewall manager supporting zones and complex rule sets.                                       |

## iptables Components

| Component | Description                                             |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Tables    | Organize and categorize firewall rules.                 |
| Chains    | Group rules applied to specific network traffic types.  |
| Rules     | Define matching criteria and actions for traffic.       |
| Matches   | Specify matching criteria (IP, port, protocol, etc.).   |
| Targets   | Define the action to perform (ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, etc.)|

## Tables in iptables

| Table Name | Purpose                                               | Built-in Chains                        |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **filter** | Filter network traffic (IP, ports, protocols)        | INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD                |
| **nat**    | Modify source/destination IP addresses (NAT)         | PREROUTING, POSTROUTING               |
| **mangle** | Modify packet header fields                           | PREROUTING, OUTPUT, INPUT, FORWARD, POSTROUTING |
| **raw**    | Special packet processing options                     | PREROUTING, OUTPUT                   |

---

## Chains in iptables

- **Built-in Chains:** Automatically created with tables.
  - *filter*: INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD
  - *nat*: PREROUTING, POSTROUTING
  - *mangle*: PREROUTING, OUTPUT, INPUT, FORWARD, POSTROUTING

- **User-defined Chains:** Custom chains to organize rules by specific criteria, e.g., traffic for a specific port or group of servers.

---

## Rules and Targets

- Rules specify matching criteria and actions.
- Added to chains with `-A` option.
- Example: Allow incoming SSH (TCP port 22) traffic

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

### Common Targets

| Target Name | Description                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| ACCEPT      | Allow packet through                                   |
| DROP        | Silently drop packet                                   |
| REJECT      | Drop packet and notify source                          |
| LOG         | Log packet details                                    |
| SNAT        | Source NAT - change source IP address                 |
| DNAT        | Destination NAT - change destination IP address      |
| MASQUERADE  | Like SNAT, for dynamic IP addresses                    |
| REDIRECT    | Redirect packets to another port or IP                 |
| MARK        | Mark packets for advanced routing                      |

## Matches

Matches specify criteria to apply rules to specific packets or connections.

| Match Name  | Description                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `-p` or `--protocol` | Protocol (tcp, udp, icmp)                     |

### Example Rule Using Match Module

Allow incoming HTTP (TCP port 80) traffic:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
```
